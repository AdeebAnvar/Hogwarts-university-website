            <h2>Hogwarts University</h2>
            <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, commonly known as Hogwarts, is a fictional institution from J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series. Founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful witches and wizards—Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin—Hogwarts serves as a prestigious boarding school for young witches and wizards.   </p><p> The school is located in a magical castle hidden from the Muggle (non-magical) world, surrounded by lush grounds, a lake, and a forbidden forest. Hogwarts offers a wide range of magical subjects, including Potions, Transfiguration, Herbology, and Defense Against the Dark Arts, and students are sorted into one of four houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin—each with its own unique traits and values.</p>
            
            <p> Hogwarts is renowned not only for its academic excellence but also for its rich history and traditions, including the Triwizard Tournament and the Yule Ball. The school plays a central role in the "Harry Potter" narrative, serving as a sanctuary for students facing the dangers of the wizarding world, particularly the looming threat of Lord Voldemort.</p>
            
            <p>  With its iconic architecture, enchanting ambiance, and a strong sense of community, Hogwarts represents a place of learning, friendship, and adventure, captivating the imaginations of readers and fans around the globe.</p>
